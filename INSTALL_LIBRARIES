                       How to Build Trilinos for Tramonto 5.0

Note:

    When accessing these instructions from the website, it is a good idea
    to verify that you have the version of the instructions that corresponds
    to your version of Tramonto.  The correct version of the instructions can
    always be found in the README file in the top level directory of a Tramonto
    tarball, or a checked out copy of the Tramonto source code repository.

        2.2 Tpetra Configure

1. Prerequisites:

    Tramonto depends on a number of other software packages.  Below is a 
    list of the required packages and links from which you can download 
    any packages that are not available on your system.  There is a good
    chance that BLAS, LAPACK and an MPI implementation are already installed
    on your system.  It is especially important to have a BLAS library that
    is optimized for your machine.  

        Package                       Web Reference
        BLAS             	http://www.netlib.org
        LAPACK           	http://www.netlib.org
        MPI              	http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich2
                         	http://www.open-mpi.org
        Trilinos         	http://trilinos.sandia.gov
	SuperLU (optional)	http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/
        QT (optional)    	http://www.qt-project.org
        QD (optional)    	http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist/qd-2.3.13.tar.gz 
        Eigen (optional) 	http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/

    
    The Tramonto 5.0 release includes a beta version of a Qt based GUI
    for Tramonto.  Qt can be downloaded from http://www.qt-project.org.  The
    Tramonto GUI is compatible with Qt-4.8. QD is useful only with the 
    Tpetra-based solver stack in Trilinos (see below for more information.)

2. Building Trilinos - general instructions:

    While BLAS, LAPACK and MPI could be available on your system, you will
    most likely have to build Trilinos yourself.  

    There are two different Trilinos builds that can be used with Tramonto. You must 
    choose one. The first option is to use the older but very stable Epetra-based 
    solver stack, and the second option is to use the next-generation Tpetra-based 
    solver stack, currently  under very active development. It is recommended that 
    you build Tramonto with the most recent versions of the trilinos library. 
    As of March 2013, that is trilinos-11.0.3.

    The Epetra-based solver stack utilizes the Epetra parallel matrix/vector 
    library within Trilinos, as well as closely related packages. The average 
    Tramonto user will want to use this solver stack. To use Tramonto with the 
    Epetra-based solver stack, Trilinos must be built with the following trilinos packages: 
    amesos, aztecoo, triutils, ifpack, epetraext, epetra, loca, ml, nox, teuchos, and
    optionally optika (to enable the GUI).

    The Tpetra-based solver stack utilizes the Tpetra (templated Petra) parallel matrix/vector 
    library within Trilinos, as well as closely related packages. Tpetra and related packages 
    represent the next generation of software with Trilinos. These packages template the scalar 
    and ordinal types, allowing, for example, computation in extended-precision, as well as 
    the solution of problems with more than 2 billion unknowns. Tramonto users facing extremely 
    large or challenging problems may wan to use this solver stack. 
    To use Tramonto with the Tpetra-based solver stack, Trilinos 
    must be built with the following trilinos packages: 
    amezoz, aztecoo, belos, epetra, epetraext, ifpack, ifpack2, ml, muelu, nox, stratimikos,
    teuchos, thyra, thyratpetraadapeters, tpetra, zoltan2, and optionally optika (to enable the GUI).

    Note that as of March 2013, MueLu has not been released as part of the trilinos library, but will
    be made available in a future 2013 release. For now, to obtain MueLu, you must check out 
    a copy of Trilinos from the public git repository by following the instructions here:
    http://trilinos.sandia.gov/publicRepo/index.html. 

    The Tpetra-based solver stack requires that the SuperLU library be installed, and that 
    Trilinos be configured with SuperLU enabled. Instructions for this are given at the bottom.
    
    To enable extended precision computation, the QD library must also be built, and Trilinos
    must be configured with QD and a third-party-library. Instructions for this are given at the 
    bottom. 

    Trilinos has a webpage for new users available at
    http://trilinos.sandia.gov/getting_started.html.
    Below you will find a brief set of instructions that focus on building
    Trilinos for use with Tramonto.  If these instructions prove insufficient,
    please visit the website listed above.
    
    Trilinos can be downloaded from the the Trilinos home page listed above.
    There are many options available in configuring Trilinos, some of the 
    most important one are:
    
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=

        This option specifies where to install Trilinos.  For example,
        CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/path/TrilinosInstall will install Trilinos
        libraries in /path/TrilinosInstall/lib and Trilinos header files in
        /path/TrilinosInstall/include.

    TPL_ENABLE_MPI:BOOL=ON

        This option indicates that a parallel, rather than serial, 
        version of Trilinos should be built.

    DMPI_BASE_DIR:PATH=

        Use this option to specify the base installation directory for MPI.
        In many cases when using a standard setup, this is not necessary,
        but the option is useful when a machine contains multiple mpi
        installations, or mpi is installed in a non-standard location.  If
        /path is the base installation directory, /path/include contains mpi.h,
        /path/lib includes the mpi libraries, and /path/bin contains mpiexec
        (or equivalent mpi executable).
 
    TPL_BLAS_LIBRARIES:STRING=
    TPL_LAPACK_LIBRARIES:SRING=

        These options are used to specify the names or locations of the BLAS
        and LAPACK libraries.  If the options are not specified, Trilinos
        will attempt to find BLAS and LAPACK.  Again, it is best to 
        explicitly list the libraries you want to use if there are 
        multiple libraries available on your machine.  Example usage:
        TPL_BLAS_LIBRARIES:STRING="-lcblas;-lf77blas;-latlas;-lgfortran" or 
        TPL_BLAS_LIBRARIES:STRING=/usr/lib64/libblas.so and
        TPL_LAPACK_LIBRARIES:STRING=/usr/lib64/liblapack.so

    Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES:BOOL=OFF 
    Trilinos_ENABLE_<package>:BOOL=ON

        The best way to build only the packages that Tramonto uses is to use 
        the Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES:BOOL=OFF option in conjunction with
        a Trilinos_ENABLE_<package>:BOOL=ON option for each required
        Trilinos package.  For example Trilinos_ENABLE_AztecOO:BOOL=ON, etc.
        Note that it is not necessary to disable all of the packages that
        Tramonto does not use; this is especially useful when building Tramonto
        on a machine that has a pre-installed version of Trilinos.  It can be
        helpful to disable unneeded packages to make it easier and faster to
        build Trilinos.


2.1 Epetra based Trilinos Build:
    Below are examples of ways to properly configure Trilinos for Epetra builds.  
    You can find more examples in the "sampleScripts" directory in the Trilinos
    distribution.  The configure command points up one directory because the
    preferred directory structure for building Trilinos has separate build and 
    source trees.  For example, for a build tree named "TramontoInstall",
    from the top-level Trilinos directory, type "mkdir TramontoInstall",
    then "cd TramontoInstall", and finally provide the proper configure
    arguments.  Some users prefer for the build tree to be a peer to the
    top-level Trilinos directory.  The source tree can be in any arbitrary
    location; the last argument in the configuration command simply has to
    point to the source tree with an absolute or relative path.  Often it is
    convenient to create a script (like those in the sampleScripts directory
    mentioned above) in the build directory and then simply source the script.
    If a separate build tree is not used, the configure process will terminate
    with an error.

    Once you have configured Trilinos, build it by typing "make".  
    This will build the libraries, tests (if Trilinos_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON),
    and examples for the packages that were enabled at configure time.  If
    the tests were compiled, a test suite can be run by typing "ctest".
    Finally, install Trilinos using "make install".

2.2 Tpetra based Trilinos Build:
    Below are examples of ways to properly configure Trilinos for Tpetra builds.  
    You can find more examples in the "sampleScripts" directory in the Trilinos
    distribution.  The configure command points up one directory because the
    preferred directory structure for building Trilinos has separate build and 
    source trees.  For example, for a build tree named "TramontoInstall",
    from the top-level Trilinos directory, type "mkdir TramontoInstall",
    then "cd TramontoInstall", and finally provide the proper configure
    arguments.  Some users prefer for the build tree to be a peer to the
    top-level Trilinos directory.  The source tree can be in any arbitrary
    location; the last argument in the configuration command simply has to
    point to the source tree with an absolute or relative path.  Often it is
    convenient to create a script (like those in the sampleScripts directory
    mentioned above) in the build directory and then simply source the script.
    If a separate build tree is not used, the configure process will terminate
    with an error.

2.3 Required Libraries for Tpetra based Build:
    * SuperLU
    The SuperLU library, written by X. Sherry Li, Jim Demmel, John Gilbert, Laura Grigori, Meiyue Shao, and Ichitaro Yamazakim, is a general purpose library 
    to compute the LU factorization of a matrix and perform triangular solves through forward and back substitution.
    To install SuperLU on your machine, follow the build instructions distributed with SuperLU. 

2.4 Optional Libraries for Tpetra based Build:
    Additional functionality can be enabled through the Tpetra based build via 
    additional libraries, which we describe below. 

    * QD
    The QD library, or "quad-double" library, written by David Bailey,
    enables extended precision computation. This allows the Tpetra based solvers
    to solve linear systems in much higher precision than afforded by double precision.
    This is especially useful for physically ill-conditioned systems, where a quad-double
    precision solver may converge even if a double precision solver never will. 

    After installing the QD library, add the following lines to your Trilinos configuration
    script to tell Trilinos where the QD library is installed:
     -DTPL_ENABLE_QD:BOOL=ON \
     -DTPL_QD_LIBRARIES:FILEPATH=/usr/local/qd/lib/libqd.a \
     -DTPL_QD_INCLUDE_DIRS:FILEPATH=/usr/local/qd/include \

    * Eigen
    Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra. It provides a templated implementation 
    of LAPACK routines used by other Trilinos solver components within Tramonto, and is required
    when doing extended-precision computation (i.e., when not using double or single precision
    arithmetic.)


    After installing the Eigen library, add the following lines to your Trilinos configuration
    script to tell Trilinos where the Eigen library is installed:
    -DTPL_ENABLE_Eigen:BOOL=ON \
    -DTPL_Eigen_INCLUDE_DIRS:FILEPATH=/usr/local/eigen/include/eigen3 \
   

    You must follow some additional steps when building Tramonto to get it to utilize 
    extended precision arithmetic. These are detailed in the section describing the 
    setup of Tramonto.
