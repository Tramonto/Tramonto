Tramonto v5.0 Release Notes

* Tramonto-5.0 is a major release delivered in October 2013.
* It is recommended that all users upgrade to Tramonto5.0.
* New features and capabilities in Tramonto 5.0 include:

  Software Features

   - GUI (beta)  - Tramonto 5.0 delivers a beta version of a GUI for Tramonto.
     The GUI is designed based on Teuchos and Optika classes and also requires
     QT to run.  The version of the GUI included with Tramonto 5.0 is still
     being developed and refined, and we are seeking input from users who
     elect to try this beta software.

   - ctest - New, comprehensive testing capabilities are available to users via
     ctest.  All the example problems in the Tramonto repository are included
     in one or more of five testing categories.  Those categories are based on
     runtimes as benchmarked on an 8-processor Mac OS X desktop machine with
     2.66 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xenon processors and 16 GB of RAM.  The specific
     ctest categories, the maximum individual runtimes, and the numbers of test
     in those categories are:

               Sanity (30 sec :: 57 cases )
               Checkin (100 sec :: 89 cases)
               Continuous (600 sec :: 122 cases)
               Nightly (2000 sec :: 133 cases)
               Occasional (7200 sec :: 144 cases)

  New Physics Features

   - Fickian Diffusion code extended to chain molecules. (see
     Tramonto/Examples/DIFFUSION2_FMT1_WCA_WJDC_1D)

   - Tethered chain capability rewritten and generalized to be able to treat:

        -- arbitrary surface geometry
        -- 2D and 3D systems
        -- mixtures of tethered chains
        -- tethered branched chains
        -- constant surface density or number of tethered chains

     See the Tramonto/Examples/POLYGRAFT cases.

  New Solver Functionality

   - Tpetra based solvers delivered for Tramonto, enabling extended-precision computation.

   - Picard solver extended to electrostatic systems. (see Tramonto/Examples/MIX13_ELEC_PICARD_1D)

   - Picard solver extended to diffusion systems.

   - Newton solver extended to tehtered chain systems.

   - Parallel computing capability implemented for tethered chain systems.

  Refactored Code and Bug fixes

   - Addition of more than 14 new example problems to the release with an emphasis on diffusion and tethered polymer cases.

   - Refactored file I/O to allow for user definition of input and output paths.

   - Refactored of input code to allow for GUI based input streams.  The code allows generation of a GUI state using static input parameters.

Tramonto v4.0.1 Release Notes

* Tramonto-4.0.1 is a release of bug fixes to Tramonto 4.0.
* The following issues are addressed:

    - Bug fix for electrostatic free energy. Uninitialized variable causing
      failure on some platforms.
    - Bug fix for WJDC polymer recursion equation. Bug in residual and Jacobian
      affecting some polymer mixtures with varying bead sizes.
    - Bug fixes for atomistic diffusion cases. Atomistic diffusion working with
      standard AztecOO solvers (not Picard solvers or Schur solvers yet). One
      new test case is included in this release to demonstrate color diffusion
      through a permeable membrane.
    - Bug fix to include electrostatic term in bulk pressure calculation. Note
      that it is only nonzero if the DELTAC_GENERAL term is turned on and if
      the ion sizes differ.

Tramonto v3.1 Release Notes

* Tramonto-3.1 is a minor release completed in August, 2009 that includes with some bug fixes and new functionality as itemized here.  
* It is recommended that all existing users download Tramonto-3.1.  
* See v3.0 release notes below for more details on recent and developing features in the Tramonto code.</p>
* New features & bug fixes in the 3.1 release are as follows:
         -- New type of boundary condition (LAST_NODE_RESTART) is added to facilitate maintaining a solved 
		boundary condition for a complex interface when surfaces are added to the problem. 
         -- Two new interaction potentials (square well, PAIR_SW, and cut and shifted exponential, PAIR_EXP_CS) 
		are added to the suite of interaction potential options.</li>
         -- New Restart type (RESTART_FEWERCOMP) implemented to allow Restart of a multicomponent system from a 
 		file that contains a solved profile for fewer components.  This is particularly helpful when 
		studying contaminants at two phase interfaces. 
         -- A bug fix has been implemented for the printing of WJDC field parameters.  This bug fix properly 
		removes the Physiscs scaling parameters prior to printing.  This field is only printed when 
		Iwrite=VERBOSE, however the bug was causing problems with retsarts in various problems. 
         -- Several optimizations have been implemented for large scale parallel computing using Tramonto. 
         -- Bug fix for Type_pairPot=4 case.  Previous release had a small positive contribution to the 
		attractive term for 0<r<sigma.  Current version fixes this error.

Tramonto v3.0 Release Notes

*Tramonto-3.0 Is the second open source release of the Tramonto software completed in March 2009. 

*New features of the 3.0 release are as follows:
	-- Linear bonded systems have been implemented using the functionals of Jain, Dominik, and Chapman, J. Chem. Phys., 2007. 
	-- Branched bonded systems have been implemented using the functionals of 
           Jain and Chapman, manuscript in preparation for J. Chem. Phys., 2009.
	-- Generalized continuation methods have been implemented for multicomponent systems.
        -- Segregation of supported general continuation methods, archived specialized contuation methods, 
           and user plugin continuation methods. These developments allow users to implement new and specialized 
           continuation methods with no significant impact on core Tramonto source code. 
	-- New continuation capability for performing binodal (phase transition tracking) calculations with mesh size as one 
           continuation parameter. Makes studies of confined phase transitions more automated.
	-- New continuation capability for using chemical potential as a continuation variable - makes bulk phase transition studies possible.
	-- An improved interface for setting up two phase interface or diffusion calculations has been developed.
	-- Implementations include improved flexibility for performing bulk calculations including generating Pxy diagrams in 
           mixtures and performing partitioning studies. 
	-- Improved methods for generating initial guesses.  It is now possible for Tramonto to automatically generate initial 
           guesses for all field variables that are fully consistent with the initial guess for the density.  It is still possible 
           to generate guesses where all variables are based on bulk parameters as well. 
	-- Restart files only require density inputs at this time.  All other fields are generated automatically. For polymer systems 
           any calculation can be started by providing either segment density profiles or component density profiles.
	-- New Picard and mixed Picard/Newton solver methods are now available with both built-in and NOX libraries. 
	-- Schur solver capabilities have been expanded to treat branched polymer systems, and new Jain-Dominik-Chapman polymer functionals. 
	-- Significantly expanded test harness (80 Example problems provided for testing and reference) including a variety of physical 
           problems from bulk Pxy diagrams to self-assembled fluids. 

* Developing (not fully implemented or not extensively tested) features in Tramonto as of the 3.0 release are as follows:
	-- Polarizeable fluids are limited to 1-dimensional computational systems.
	-- Tethered polymer chains are only available to 1-dimensional computational systems.
	-- Electrostatics methods are available, but not mature, and force sum rules are only correct for Poisson-Boltzmann electrolyte models. 
	-- Steady-State Diffusion methods are availbale, but have not be heavily used and tested. 
	-- Rough surfaces have been implemented for some surface types, but have not been extensively tested.

Tramonto v2.1 Release Notes

* Tramonto-2.1 is the first general release of the open source software Tramonto (available in March 2007).

* Tramonto-2.1 has been significantly refactored from the v2.0 limited release to improve the ease with which new physics functionality can be implemented. (see the Making Physics Modifications page for details).

* Tramonto-2.1 has a new implementation of Yukawa fluids for modeling colloidal systems.

* An interface to NOX solvers exists in the Tramonto-v2.1 release, but NOX is not the default nonlinear solver at the time of the v2.1 release.

* Some known shortcomings of the software are listed in the v2.0 release notes below.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tramonto v2.0 Release Notes

* This version is a limited release version of Tramonto being implemented in 
preparation for the v2.1 public release in early 2007.

* Computation of Electrostatic Free Energy is implemented only approximately 
except for the special case of the Poissson-Boltzmann electrolyte where the 
implementation is exact.

* The pressure for WTC functionals (Tripathi-Chapman functionals using 
Werthiem's theory) has not been implemented.

* Computation of bulk two phase coexistence is currently disabled and has not
been implemented generally.

* Stoichiometry errors (usually small) can be observed in CMS 
(Chandler-McCoy-Singer) functionals when hard surfaces are used.

* Stoichiometry errors (of varying severity) are often observed with WTC 
functionals - to our knowledge, this is a short-coming of the theoretical 
approach and not related to errors in implementation.
