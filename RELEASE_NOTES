Tramonto v4.0 Release Notes

* Tramonto-4.0 is a major release delivered in July of 2011.
* It is recommended that all users upgrade to Tramonto-4.0. 
* New features and capabilities in Tramonto-4.0 include:

  Build System

   - A cmake-based build system that is consistent with Trilinos 10.x.
   - Tramonto now can be built on Windows through Visual Studio. The Windows
     build is not fully supported for this release. We are planning to add a
     Windows installer for future releases.

  New Physics

   - Implementaion of a fourth hard-sphere FMT method.
   - Generalized electrostatics methods for electrolytes with species of unlike
     size.
   - Generalized methods for defining attractive functionals.
   - New pair potential interactions for summed Yukawa with repulsions to allow
     for studies of coarse-grained electrostatics systems. 
   - Option for manual input of hard sphere diameters to allow for studies of
     nonadditive potentials.
   - Implementation of automated output for sum rule studies. 
   - Generalization of surface modifications (roughess, periodic, and linear
     functions) to simple surfaces. 
   - Generalized external field code to allow for different types of surfaces
     (e.g. Lennard-Jones and Yukawa) in one calculation. 

  New Solver Functionality

   - Implementation of Schur solvers for analytic Jacobians for WJDC3 polymer
     methods. 
   - Implementation of Schur solvers for charged systems.
   - Manual input option for physics based scaling of WJDC polymer systems.
   - Picard and Newton iterations and tolerances changed to be set
     independently. 

  Refactored Code and Bug Fixes

   - Surface geometry code refactored to allow for easier code extensions and
     modifications. 
   - External field code refactored to simplify treatment of any case where the
     external field is based on distance to surface or distance to center of
     wall or atom. 
   - A new numerical scheme for computing derivatives of external field for
     every case except integrated surfaces. 
   - Addition of more than 40 new example problems to the release with a
     special emphasis on 2D and 3D problems of various geometries.
   - Bug fixes for free energy calculations in charged systems.
   - Bug fixes for LAST_NODE boundary conditions.

Tramonto v3.1 Release Notes

* Tramonto-3.1 is a minor release completed in August, 2009 that includes with some bug fixes and new functionality as itemized here.  
* It is recommended that all existing users download Tramonto-3.1.  
* See v3.0 release notes below for more details on recent and developing features in the Tramonto code.</p>
* New features & bug fixes in the 3.1 release are as follows:
         -- New type of boundary condition (LAST_NODE_RESTART) is added to facilitate maintaining a solved 
		boundary condition for a complex interface when surfaces are added to the problem. 
         -- Two new interaction potentials (square well, PAIR_SW, and cut and shifted exponential, PAIR_EXP_CS) 
		are added to the suite of interaction potential options.</li>
         -- New Restart type (RESTART_FEWERCOMP) implemented to allow Restart of a multicomponent system from a 
 		file that contains a solved profile for fewer components.  This is particularly helpful when 
		studying contaminants at two phase interfaces. 
         -- A bug fix has been implemented for the printing of WJDC field parameters.  This bug fix properly 
		removes the Physiscs scaling parameters prior to printing.  This field is only printed when 
		Iwrite=VERBOSE, however the bug was causing problems with retsarts in various problems. 
         -- Several optimizations have been implemented for large scale parallel computing using Tramonto. 
         -- Bug fix for Type_pairPot=4 case.  Previous release had a small positive contribution to the 
		attractive term for 0<r<sigma.  Current version fixes this error.

Tramonto v3.0 Release Notes

*Tramonto-3.0 Is the second open source release of the Tramonto software completed in March 2009. 

*New features of the 3.0 release are as follows:
	-- Linear bonded systems have been implemented using the functionals of Jain, Dominik, and Chapman, J. Chem. Phys., 2007. 
	-- Branched bonded systems have been implemented using the functionals of 
           Jain and Chapman, manuscript in preparation for J. Chem. Phys., 2009.
	-- Generalized continuation methods have been implemented for multicomponent systems.
        -- Segregation of supported general continuation methods, archived specialized contuation methods, 
           and user plugin continuation methods. These developments allow users to implement new and specialized 
           continuation methods with no significant impact on core Tramonto source code. 
	-- New continuation capability for performing binodal (phase transition tracking) calculations with mesh size as one 
           continuation parameter. Makes studies of confined phase transitions more automated.
	-- New continuation capability for using chemical potential as a continuation variable - makes bulk phase transition studies possible.
	-- An improved interface for setting up two phase interface or diffusion calculations has been developed.
	-- Implementations include improved flexibility for performing bulk calculations including generating Pxy diagrams in 
           mixtures and performing partitioning studies. 
	-- Improved methods for generating initial guesses.  It is now possible for Tramonto to automatically generate initial 
           guesses for all field variables that are fully consistent with the initial guess for the density.  It is still possible 
           to generate guesses where all variables are based on bulk parameters as well. 
	-- Restart files only require density inputs at this time.  All other fields are generated automatically. For polymer systems 
           any calculation can be started by providing either segment density profiles or component density profiles.
	-- New Picard and mixed Picard/Newton solver methods are now available with both built-in and NOX libraries. 
	-- Schur solver capabilities have been expanded to treat branched polymer systems, and new Jain-Dominik-Chapman polymer functionals. 
	-- Significantly expanded test harness (80 Example problems provided for testing and reference) including a variety of physical 
           problems from bulk Pxy diagrams to self-assembled fluids. 

* Developing (not fully implemented or not extensively tested) features in Tramonto as of the 3.0 release are as follows:
	-- Polarizeable fluids are limited to 1-dimensional computational systems.
	-- Tethered polymer chains are only available to 1-dimensional computational systems.
	-- Electrostatics methods are available, but not mature, and force sum rules are only correct for Poisson-Boltzmann electrolyte models. 
	-- Steady-State Diffusion methods are availbale, but have not be heavily used and tested. 
	-- Rough surfaces have been implemented for some surface types, but have not been extensively tested.

Tramonto v2.1 Release Notes

* Tramonto-2.1 is the first general release of the open source software Tramonto (available in March 2007).

* Tramonto-2.1 has been significantly refactored from the v2.0 limited release to improve the ease with which new physics functionality can be implemented. (see the Making Physics Modifications page for details).

* Tramonto-2.1 has a new implementation of Yukawa fluids for modeling colloidal systems.

* An interface to NOX solvers exists in the Tramonto-v2.1 release, but NOX is not the default nonlinear solver at the time of the v2.1 release.

* Some known shortcomings of the software are listed in the v2.0 release notes below.

Tramonto v2.0 Release Notes

* This version is a limited release version of Tramonto being implemented in 
preparation for the v2.1 public release in early 2007.

* Computation of Electrostatic Free Energy is implemented only approximately 
except for the special case of the Poissson-Boltzmann electrolyte where the 
implementation is exact.

* The pressure for WTC functionals (Tripathi-Chapman functionals using 
Werthiem's theory) has not been implemented.

* Computation of bulk two phase coexistence is currently disabled and has not
been implemented generally.

* Stoichiometry errors (usually small) can be observed in CMS 
(Chandler-McCoy-Singer) functionals when hard surfaces are used.

* Stoichiometry errors (of varying severity) are often observed with WTC 
functionals - to our knowledge, this is a short-coming of the theoretical 
approach and not related to errors in implementation.
