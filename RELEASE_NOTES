Tramonto v2.0 Release Notes

* This version is a limited release version of Tramonto being implemented in 
preparation for the v2.1 public release in early 2007.

* Computation of Electrostatic Free Energy is implemented only approximately 
except for the special case of the Poissson-Boltzmann electrolyte where the 
implementation is exact.

* The pressure for WTC functionals (Tripathi-Chapman functionals using 
Werthiem's theory) has not been implemented.

* Computation of bulk two phase coexistence is currently disabled and has not
been implemented generally.

* Stoichiometry errors (usually small) can be observed in CMS 
(Chandler-McCoy-Singer) functionals when hard surfaces are used.

* Stoichiometry errors (of varying severity) are often observed with WTC 
functionals - to our knowledge, this is a short-coming of the theoretical 
approach and not related to errors in implementation.
