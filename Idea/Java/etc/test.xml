				Thank you for trying Maui. 
				Your installation appears to be correct.  Click 
				on the "Exit" button to quit Maui.  You may then 
				restart Maui with your own application, or as 
				directed in the Maui Tutorial.  A postscript 
				version is contained in 
				$IDEA_HOME/Idea/Doc/tutorials/maui/MauiTutorial.ps
				or you can point your browser at 
				$IDEA_HOME/Idea/Doc/tutorials/maui/MauiTutorial/index.html.

				Thanks again.
