    Building Tramonto
 

Prerequisites:

    Tramonto depends on a number of other software packages.  Below is a 
    list of the required packages and links from which you can download 
    any packages that are not available on your system.  There is a good
    chance that BLAS, LAPACK and an MPI implementation are already installed
    on your system.  It is especially important to have a BLAS library that
    is optimized for your machine.  

        Package                       Web Reference
        BLAS                       http://www.netlib.org
        LAPACK                     http://www.netlib.org
        MPI                        http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich2
                                   http://www.open-mpi.org
        Trilinos (7.0.0 or later*) http://trilinos.sandia.gov

    *The instructions below explain how to build with Trilinos 8.0.0 or later.
    
    While BLAS, LAPACK and MPI could be available on your system, you will
    most likely have to build Trilinos yourself.  Trilinos contains several
    packages of which Tramonto requires amesos, aztecoo, triutils, ifpack,
    epetraext, epetra, loca, ml, nox, and teuchos loca.

    Trilinos has a webpage for new users available at
    http://trilinos.sandia.gov/getting_started.html.
    Below you will find a brief set of instructions that focus on building
    Trilinos for use with Tramonto.  If these instructions prove insufficient,
    please visit the website listed above.
    
Building Trilinos:

    As of October 2006, Tramonto requires Trilinos version 7.0.0 or later.
    The instructions below explain how to build with Trilinos 8.0.X or 9.0.X.

    Trilinos can be downloaded from the the Trilinos home page listed above.
    There are many options available in configuring Trilinos, some of the 
    most important one are:
    
    --prefix=

        This option specifies where to install Trilinos.  For example,
        --prefix=/path/TrilinosInstall will install Trilinos libraries
        in /path/TrilinosInstall/lib and Tramonto header files in
        /path/TrilinosInstall/include.

    --enable-mpi

        This option indicates that a parallel, rather than serial, 
        version of Trilinos should be built.  This option is set
        automatically when the --with-mpi-compilers option is used.

    --with-mpi-compilers

        This option simplifies the process of specifying information about
        compilers and mpi.  If your machine has compiler wrappers installed
        (try 'which mpicc'), it may be possible to **use this option
        in place of the next five options**.  The compiler wrappers simply
        wrap the system default compilers (e.x. g++, gcc, and gfortran),
        and contain information about the location of the mpi library and
        headers, as well as the name of the mpi library.

    --with-mpi=

        This option can be used to specify the location of mpi on your
        machine.  For example, if mpi.h is in /path/include, and libmpi.a
        is in /path/lib, use --with-mpi=/path.  In the unlikely event that
        mpi is not installed with the same base path, it is possible to
        replace this option with --with-mpi-incdir=/path1/include and
        --with-mpi-libdir=/path2/lib.

    --with-mpi-libs=

        By default, Trilinos will try to link to mpi using -lmpi.  The
        default can be modified with this option.  For example, if using
        mpich, you might use --with-mpi-libs=-lmpich, or 
        --with-mpi-libs="-lmpich -lpmpich".

    CC=
    CXX=
    F77=

        These options can be used to specify the names and, optionally,
        the locations of the C, C++ and Fortran compilers.  For example,
        CC=pgcc, CXX=pgCC, F77=pgf77.  If these options are not used
        (and the --with-mpi-compilers option is not used), Trilinos
        will attempt to locate your compilers.  It is often best to
        explicitly list the compilers you want to use, especially if
        there are multiple compiler sets installed on your machine.

    --with-blas=
    --with-lapack=

        These options are used to specify the locations of the BLAS and
        LAPACK libraries.  If the options are not specified, Trilinos
        will attempt to find BLAS and LAPACK.  Again, it is best to 
        explicitly list the libraries you want to use if there are 
        multiple libraries available on your machine.  Example usage:
        --with-blas="/path/lib -lcblas -lf77blas -latlas" or 
        --with-blas="-L/opt/intel/mkl/lib/32 -lmkl_ia32 -lguide" and
        --with-lapack=/path/lib/liblapack.a or
        --with-lapack="-L/opt/intel/mkl/lib/32 -lmkl_lapack"

    --disable-default-packages
    --enable-<package>

        A number of Trilinos packages are built by default.  This list
        does not match the list of packages that Tramonto requires.
        The best way to build only the packages that Tramonto will use is
        to use the --disable-default-packages option in conjunction with
        an --enable-<package> option for each required Trilinos package.
        For example --enable-epetra, enable-aztecoo, etc.

    When installing Trilinos for use with Tramonto, one should not use
    the --disable-libcheck option.  Using this option will result in
    problems with linking to BLAS and LAPACK.  Compiling, linking, and
    running one or more Trilinos tests or examples is strongly recommended.

    Below are examples of ways to invoke the configure script to
    properly configure Trilinos.  You can find more examples in the
    "sampleScripts" directory withing the Trilinos distribution.
    The configure command points up one directory because the preferred
    directory structure for building Trilinos has separate build and 
    source trees.  For example, for a build tree named "TramontoInstall",
    from the top-level Trilinos directory, type "mkdir TramontoInstall",
    then "cd TramontoInstall", and finally provide the proper configure
    arguments.  Often it is convenient to create a script (like those
    in the sampleScripts directory mentioned above) in the build 
    directory and then simply source the script.  The separate build
    tree is highly recommended to help avoid "polluting" the 
    source tree, which can cause odd problems when building.

        --with-mpi-libs=-lmpich \
        --with-mpi=/home/jmwille/MPICH/SDK.gcc

    Once you have configured Trilinos, build it by typing "make everything".  
    This will build the libraries, tests, and examples for the packages that
    were enabled at configure time.  If you have built Trilinos before, and
    want to build only the libraries, type "make" instead of
    "make everything".  If the tests were compiled, a test suite can be run
    using the runtests-mpi make target.  For example, 
    make runtests-mpi TRILINOS_MPI_GO="'mpiexec -np '" 
    invokes the target, and provides information necessary for running
    mpi enabled executables.  If your machine requires a command other than
    "mpiexec" for running executables, for example, "mpirun", or an option
    other than "-np " for specifying the number of processes, for example,
    "-n ", adjust the above listed command as appropriate.  Note that 
    double quoting, either using different types of quotes, or escaping
    the inner pair of quotes is necessary.  For example,
    TRILINOS_MPI_GO="\"~/bin/linux/mpirun -np \"".
    Finally, install Trilinos using "make install".


Building Tramonto:

    Once Trilinos has been built, building Tramonto tends to be 
    straightforward because some of the options that were used to build
    Trilinos can be used again to build Tramonto.  As with Trilinos, 
    it is necessary to configure and then build Tramonto.  Since 
    Tramonto produces only a single executable, there is no need to 
    install it and at this time there is not a make target for testing.
    
    To configure Tramonto, in addition to using some of the options that
    were used to configure Trilinos, it is necessary to indicate the 
    location of the installed Trilinos libraries and header files using
    the --with-trilinos option.  This option points to the base of the 
    installed version of Trilinos.  For example, if Trilinos is configured
    with --prefix=/home/jmwille/TraInstall, use

    --with-trilinos=/home/jmwille/TraInstall

    Below are Tramonto configure invocations that correspond to the
    above Trilinos configure invocations.  These, as well as other,
    scripts can be found in the directory "sampleConfigs" in the Tramonto
    distribution.  Note that using a separate build tree is again
    recommended, as discussed in the Building Trilinos section.
    
	Linux
        ../configure  \
        --with-gnumake \
        --with-trilinos=/home/jmwille/TramontosTrilinos

        Mac OS X
        ../configure \
        --with-gnumake \
        --with-ldflags="-framework veclib -L/usr/lib/ -lSystemStubs" \
        --with-trilinos=/Users/jmwille/TraInstall

	Cygwin
        ../configure \
        --with-gnumake \
        CXX=g++ \
        CC=gcc \
        F77=g77 \
        --with-trilinos=/home/jmwille/TraInstall \
        CPPFLAGS=-DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK \
        --with-mpi-libs=-lmpich \
        --with-mpi=/home/jmwille/MPICH/SDK.gcc
	
    Once the configure script completes, you can type "make" to 
    build Tramonto. After make finishes, the Tramonto  binary, "dft" 
    can optionally be copied to a more convenient location.  Note that
    although it is not necessary to specify the locations and names of
    the BLAS and LAPACK libraries during the Tramonto configure process,
    because that information is taken from the Trilinos configuration 
    process, it is currently necessary to specify which compilers to
    use if compilers were specified during the Trilinos configuration
    process.  The same compilers should be used to build Trilinos and
    Tramonto.
