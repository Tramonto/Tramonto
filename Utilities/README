This folder contains a few useful scripts that have been developed for Tramonto

# Data Handling

1. gnuplot_heatplots2D - this short script has been developed to generate color contour plots of 
   Tramonto density output using the free software gnuplot.  It is set up for 2D systems.  The top of the
   script should be edited for a particular case.

2. reflection.py - this python3 script was developed to automatically create reflections of datasets and then
   print them out in a file with the same structure as the original Tramonto output.  This can be helpful
   when visualizing a system where the computational domain is minimized with use of reflective boundary 
   conditions, but a better understanding of the physical system can be gained by showing an extended domain
   that captures the reflected boundary conditions.
