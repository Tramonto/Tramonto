 \brief WJDC functionals: charged 10-mer and single site counterions in a hard wall slit.

Functionals: WJDC,FMT3,ELEC

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This problem is the same as POLY26 and POLY27 (a simple polyelectrolyte consisting of a hard charged 10mer chain, with hard sphere counterions) but with mixed boundary conditions: the left wall has constant charge, the right wall is at constant potential. 

Input Files for Test problem:

Key Output Parameters:
   - niter=7
   - adsorption[0]=1.52453 
   - adsorption[1]=1.35865 
   - charge = -0.165881
