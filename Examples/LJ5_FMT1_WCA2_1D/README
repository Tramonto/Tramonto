 \brief Lennard-Jones fluid at high density.

Functionals: FMT_1, WCA

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: 12-6 Lennard-Jones atomistic fluid near a 9-3 Lennard-Jones wall.  Note that
the 9-3 wall-fluid potential is cut and shifted.  This is a test problem for Type_attr=2
and has identical results to the LJ1 case.

Input Files for Test problem:
   - dft_input.dat
   - dft_surfaces.dat

Key Output Parameters:
   - niter=7 
   - adsorption=6.946833  
   - energy=-2.861495 
   - force=1.08356
