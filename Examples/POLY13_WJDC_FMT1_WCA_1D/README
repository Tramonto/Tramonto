 \brief 8-2-8 hard polymer at a hard wall.

Functionals: WJDC, FMT1, WCA

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This case is based on the POLY1_CMS_1D 
test problem with stronger attractive interactions implemented.  The direct correlation function included in this
test problem is _NOT_ needed for the WJDC functional, but is handy for running the problem using the CMS functional.
The total polymer density in the bulk for this problem is 0.711.   The 
ratio of ads[0]/ads[1] is 8.42.   

Input Files for Test problem:

Key Output Parameters:
   - niter=15 
   - adsorption[0]=19.399954 
   - adsorption[1]=2.304743  
   - energy=2.59213
