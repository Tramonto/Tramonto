 \brief 8-2-8 hard polymer at a hard wall.

Functionals: WJDC, FMT1, WCA

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This case is a restart based on the 8-2-8 lipid systems we have been studying.
Specifically it tests the restart of all fields other than the density profile for the 
case of the segment based WJDC functional (Type_poly=3).
