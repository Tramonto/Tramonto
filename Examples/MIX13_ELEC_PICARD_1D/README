 \brief Poisson-Boltzmann electrolyte (2 components). Test Picard Solver

Functionals: IDEAL ELEC

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This case is identical to MIX3_ELEC_1D except a combined picard/newton solver is used.   
The electrolyte is composed of two charged components (ions) and a dielectric continuum solvent.
The ions are treated as point particles so this is the ideal (Poisson-Boltzmann) limit
of the Density Functional Theory.  There are two surfaces in this problem each with
a surface charge per unit area of 0.6.  Note that adsorption[1]-adsorption[0]=0.6 so the electrolyte 
perfectly neutralizes the surface charge.
