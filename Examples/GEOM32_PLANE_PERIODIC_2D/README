 \brief 2D surface with superimposed periodic function (corrugated surface)

Functionals: FMT3,WCA,ELEC

Dimensions: 2

Diffusion: No

Notes: surface geometry test - a corrugated surface formed by superimposing a periodic function on a planar surface. The surface is charged, the fluid is an electrolyte.
