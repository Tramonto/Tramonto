 \brief WTC functionals: 5-mer at a hard wall.

Functionals: WTC, FMT1

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This is a simple initial test problem for the Tripathi-Chapman functionals for bonded systems based on Wertheim's theory of associating fluids.
For comparison we have the density profiles generated from Walter Chapman's isaft code included in this directory.
Again, the adsorptions of all segments should be identical for the stoichiometry of the bonded system.  The observed error is 3%.
