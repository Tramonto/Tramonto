 \brief 2D infinite cylindrical surfaces with wedges removed. compound surfaces are created by
putting pairs of complementary wedges together. Vext(integrated).  Reflective boundaries.

Functionals: FMT_1,WCA

Dimensions: 2

Diffusion: No

Notes: surface geometry test - 4 cylindrical wedge surfaces where pairs of cylindrical wedges with
different chemical properties fit together to form compound surfaces (cylinders). Vext(integrated).  Small wedges line
the interior of a pore formed by the 6 cylinders when reflective boundaries are considered.  Compare with GEOM15 case.
