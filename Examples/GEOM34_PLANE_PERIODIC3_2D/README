 \brief 2D surface with two superimposed periodic functions (corrugated surface). 

Functionals: FMT3,WCA,ELEC

Dimensions: 2

Diffusion: No

Notes: surface geometry test - a corrugated surface formed by superimposing two periodic functions on a planar surface. The surface is charged, the fluid is an electrolyte.
