 \brief 2D case - testing reflective boundaries in x direction with complex physics.

Functionals: FMT_1,WCA,ELEC

Dimensions: 2

Diffusion: No

Notes: Testing electrostatics hard sphere functionals and attractions simultaneously.  The resolution is rather low in order to facilitate a reasonably fast test even on a relatively slow platform.  The problem has two charged surfaces each with a surface charge density of qe/A=0.3.  This test is
part of a series designed to test various boundary conditions.
