\brief 3D 1element (point) surfaces. 

Functionals: FMT_1,WCA,ELEC

Dimensions: 3

Diffusion: No

Notes: surface geometry test for 1elem surface type.  Note that all nodes should be designated
as fluid nodes with this type of surface.  However external fields or charges may be applied. 
This case has only a surface charge.
