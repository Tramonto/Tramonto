 \brief 1D case - locate a binodal approximately with Arc-Length continuation.  One component Liquid-Vapor equilibrium.

Functionals: FMT1,WCA

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This case tests is the first of a series involving BULK liquid-vapor equilibrium for a single component fluid.  In this problem, the chemical potential of the fluid is varied using arc length continuation and the density-pressure information is collected.  The phase transition can be found where there are two states if equal chemical potential and pressure (see dft_output.dat).  For this problem it occurs at approximately
mu=-4.62 and p=0.01.  See BULK2 case for exact binodal.
