 \brief Civilized model electrolyte (3 components).

Functionals: FMT1,ELEC

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: 1-1 electrolyte composed of two charged components (ions) and finite sized neutral solvent. In this case ions
and solvent are of equal size.   This is the so-called civilized model of Tang and Davis (1992).  Note that the 
surface charge on each of two planar surfaces is 0.3.  The difference in adsorption between the two charged 
components (0 and 1) is 0.6 indicating a charge neutral system.  This case may be compared to case MIX4_FMT1_ELEC_1D to 
see the effect of including the solvent explicitly in the calculation.
