 \brief Primitive model electrolyte (2 components) with corrections.

Functionals: FMT1,ELEC

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: 1-1 electrolyte composed of two charged components (ions) and a dielectric continuum solvent. In this case the ions
are of finite and equal sizes. In addition second order corrections to the free energy functional via the direct correlation 
function are included in this calcualtion (Tang and Davis, 1992).  Each of the two planar surfaces has a charge of 0.3 per unit 
area.  The difference in adsorption is 0.6 indicating a charge neutral surface.  Compare with MIX4_FMT1_ELEC_1D to see the 
effect of the liquid state corrections. Update on 2/3/11: Reiner-Radke approximation to the free energy has been turned off.  
Prior to this date, the energy reported in this file was surf_ex_energy=1.785214.
