 \brief WTC functionals: blocked 5-mer at a hard wall.

Functionals: WTC

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This case treats the polymer as a blocked system where we have 2 components on the 5-mer, and where the segment densities are summed into site type
densities.  The expected stoichiometric ratio is ads[0]/ads[1]=2/3.  We find 0.6865
