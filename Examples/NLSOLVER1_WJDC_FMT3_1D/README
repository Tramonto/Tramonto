 \brief NL_Solver=0 8-2-8 hard polymer at a hard wall.

Functionals: WJDC, FMT3, WCA

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes:  This case is identical to the POLY18 case (and NLSOLVER1-NLSOLVER5) and serves as the first test of nonlinear solver 
capabilities.  This case uses the built-in Newton nonlinear solver option NL_Solver=0.
