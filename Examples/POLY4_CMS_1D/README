 \brief Charged Lipid bilayer: 8-2-8 lipid plus solvent.

Functionals: CMS

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: The tail (8) segments of the polymer carry a charge of -0.0125 while the head (2) segements of the polymer
carry a charge of +0.1.  A previously converged neutral bilayer is used as the initial guess with the electrostatic field set to 1 everywhere initially.
This case demonstrates Restart option 3 where only some of the restart information is available in the files.
The stoichiometry computed for the lipid chains is: ads[0]/ads[1]/=8.000000.  Note that the area per lipid increases when the lipids are charged up 
as expected (compare with case POLY3_CMS_1D).
