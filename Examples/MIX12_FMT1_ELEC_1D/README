 \brief Primitive model electrolyte (2 components) with corrections.

Functionals: FMT1,ELEC (MSA,GEN)

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: 1-1 electrolyte composed of two charged components (ions) and a dielectric continuum solvent. In this case the ions
are of finite and equal sizes. In addition second order corrections to the free energy functional via the direct correlation 
function are included in this calcualtion using the generalized MSA corrections (Oleksy and Hansen, 2006).  
Each of the two planar surfaces has a charge of 0.3 per unit area.  The difference in adsorption is 0.6 indicating a 
charge neutral surface.  Since the ions are of equal size in this case, the results should be identical to
the results in MIX5_FMT1_ELEC_1D which is based on the more restrictive RPM-MSA corrections that assume equal diameters
of ions . Update on 2/3/11: Reiner-Radke approximation to the free energy has been turned off.
Prior to this date, the energy reported in this file was surf_ex_energy=1.785214.
