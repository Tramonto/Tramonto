 \brief 1D case - locate a binodal approximately with Arc-Length continuation.  Two component Liquid-Vapor equilibrium.

Functionals: FMT3,WCA,WJDC3

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This case is the first of a series involving BULK liquid-vapor equilibrium for TWO component fluid.  In this problem, the chemical potential of one species is varied using arc length continuation while the other remains constant.  The density-pressure information is collected for both species.  The phase transition can be found where there are two states of equal chemical potential and pressure (see dft_output.dat).  For this problem it occurs at approximately
mu[0]=-6.5 and p=0.001.  See BULK2 case for exact binodal.
