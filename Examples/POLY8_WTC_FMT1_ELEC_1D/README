 \brief WTC functionals: 5-mer at a hard wall with electrostatics.

Functionals: WTC,FMT1,ELEC

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This case is the same as POLY6_WTC_FMT1_1D except we introduce a small amount of charge as a global constraint on the stoichiometry.
An ilu preconditioner is used, and becomes necessary when the electrostatics are added to the problem.  The error in the stoichiometry is 
reduced from 3% to 0.1%.
