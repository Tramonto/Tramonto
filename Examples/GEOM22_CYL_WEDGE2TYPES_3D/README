 \brief 3D infinite length compound cylindrical wedge surfaces.  Two total surfaces each composed of two surface types. Vext(integrated)

Functionals: FMT3

Dimensions: 2

Diffusion: No

Notes: surface geometry test - two cylindrical surfaces with infinite length (Length=Size_z). 
Each surface is composed of two cylindrical wedges with different surface-fluid interactions.
Vext(integrated) is used.  Reflected planes result in hexagonal arrangment of surfaces.
