 \brief WTC functionals: blocked polymer blend.

Functionals: WTC,FMT1

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This case is a polymer blend with two polymer components.  It reproduces figure 7 of Tripathi and Chapman, J Chem. Phys. 2005.  The
first component is an 8-mer, the second component is a 4-mer.  The two species are homopolymers and the adsorption reported is a sum over the site
adsorptions for each of the 12 segments in the system.
