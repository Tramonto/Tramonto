 \brief 1D case - compute structure of liquid-vapor interface for a TWO component system.

Functionals: FMT3,WCA,WJDC3

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This case tests is the third of a series involving BULK liquid-vapor equilibrium for a TWO component fluid.  In this problem, the exact binodal found from the BULK5 calculation is used as boundary conditions for a calculation of a bulk two phase (liquid-vapor) interface.  This type of data is useful in wetting calculations.  Note that a linear density initial guess profile is used here along with a constant density region that constraints the interface to be narrow, but continuous between the two states.
