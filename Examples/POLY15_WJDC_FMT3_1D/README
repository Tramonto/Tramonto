 \brief WJDC functionals: 5-mer at a hard wall.

Functionals: WJDC, FMT3

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This is a test problem for the Jain-Dominik-Chapman functionals 
for bonded systems based on Wertheim's theory of associating fluids.  This case is identical to the
POLY10_WTC_FMT1_1D case with the following modifications: Type_poly=5 (the component based 
approach to solving the theory), the Schur solvers are turned on, Physics scaling is turned on,
the FMT functional is set to FMT3 (the White Bear functional).  
The adsorptions of all segments should be and in fact are identical for correct stoichiometry.
