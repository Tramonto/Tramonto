 \brief 2D surface with a notch removed from the surface. Charged surface with electrolyte.

Functionals: FMT3,WCA,ELEC

Dimensions: 2

Diffusion: No

Notes: surface geometry test - a planar surface with a notch removed fromt the surface using the angle-wedge functionality.
The surface is charged, the fluid is an electrolyte.
