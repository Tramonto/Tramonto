 \brief 3D model of a small AFM tip with a square pyramid structure. 

Functionals: FMT3

Dimensions: 3

Diffusion: No

Notes: surface geometry test - a 3D square pyramid interacting with a surface.  This could be one model for an AFM tip, but note the base dimension of the pyramid is smaller than a typical AFM tip by a factor of 2-5.

Input Files for Test problem:
   - dft_input.dat

Key Output Parameters:
   - niter=9
   - adsorption[0]=1323.79
   - surf_ex_energy=53.2632
