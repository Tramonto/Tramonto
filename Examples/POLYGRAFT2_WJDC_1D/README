 \brief grafted 50mer polymer attached to a noninteracting wall.

Functionals: WJDC, FMT1

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This example is for a grafted polymer.  This example is identical to POLYGRAFT1 except the Lhard condition is turned off and the end segment is not assumed to be embedded in the surface.  The solution is observed to be much less dependent on mesh spacing.
