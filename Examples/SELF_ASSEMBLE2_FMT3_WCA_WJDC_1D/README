 \brief A test of mesh continuation and the force sum rule using a calculatoin of a confined lipid bilayer system based on 8-2-8 lipid and single site solvent (1D).  These calculations use the Jain, Dominik, Chapman functionals.

Functionals: FMT3,WCA,WJDC3

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This example demonstrates continuation in mesh size for a study of a confined lipid bilayer.  In order to verify the force sum rule, the following steps can be taken.  
.
1. Use the pure solvent profile included here in a calculation where all surfaces are removed and boundary conditions are set to reflective.  In that case, the free energy will be Omega=-pV=-2.30199.  Since the domain size is 10 sigma, the pressure is psigma^3/kT=0.230199.  
2. Run the test case as it is provided here.  
3. Calculate the solvation force by shifting the force curve in dft_output.dat to zero using the value of the force at H=38.8 (force=0.102436).  Note that the discrepancy in bulk pressure is due to the coarse mesh in these calculations.  
4. Next compute the surface free energy as Omega_s/A=Omega/A+p*H (using 0.230199 as the pressure).  
5. Finally calculate the solvation force as f=-(delta Omega_s/delta H).  
.
The two solvation force cuves should match well. Note that the Omega^s field output by Tramonto for this case is not correct (as in many cases of self-assembly), because pressure calculations are based on a completely mixed polymer fluid.  When the system microphase separates, this is no longer the correct refence state for a calculation of surface free energy.
