 \brief WJDC functionals: charged 10-mer and single site counterions in a hard wall slit.

Functionals: WJDC,FMT3,ELEC

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This problem is for a simple polyelectrolyte consisting of a hard charged 10mer chain, with hard sphere counterions, confined between two charged hard walls.  The electrostatic boundary conditions are therefore Neumann on the whole boundary.
