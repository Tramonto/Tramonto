 \brief WJDC functionals: blocked polymer blend.

Functionals: WJDC,FMT1

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This case is a polymer blend with two polymer components.  Like the POLY9 test case, it is based on 
parameters used to generate  figure 7 of Tripathi and Chapman, J Chem. Phys. 2005.  The
first component is an 8-mer, the second component is a 4-mer.  
The two species are homopolymers and the adsorption reported is a sum over the segment
adsorptions for the segments on the 8-mer (adsorption[0]) and the 4-mer (adsorption[1]).

Input Files for Test problem:
   - dft_input.dat
   - dft_surfaces.dat
   - lin_8_lin_4

Key Output Parameters:
   - niter=6
   - adsorption[0]=11.376882
   - adsorption[1]=10.238604
   - energy=1.0846
