 \brief WTC functionals: 3-mer at a hard wall.

Functionals: WTC, FMT1

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This is a simple initial test problem for the Tripathi-Chapman functionals for bonded systems based on Wertheim's theory of associating fluids.
Note that the adsorptions of all species should be identical for the stoichiometry of the bonded system.  The observed error is 25%.

Input Files for Test problem:
   - dft_input.dat
   - dft_surfaces.dat

Key Output Parameters:
   - niter=13
   - adsorption[0,2]=0.457427
   - adsorption[1]=0.579423
   - energy=-2.380944
