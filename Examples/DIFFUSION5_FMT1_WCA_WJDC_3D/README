 \brief Color diffusion (Fickian) of a bonded chain fluid through a permeable membrane for a 3D system.

Functionals: FMT1, WCA, WJDC

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: Two component neutral Lennard-Jones chain fluid system.  This tests the polymer Fickian diffusion implementation
for a 3D system.  The results here can be compared with teh DIFFUSION2 case; however the mesh is signficantly coarsened in this case
for faster 3D calculations in the test harness.

Input Files for Test problem:
