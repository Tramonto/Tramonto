 \brief Lipid bilayer system based on 8-2-8 lipid and single site solvent (1D) using Jain, Dominik, Chapman functionals.

Functionals: FMT3,WCA,WJDC3

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This example demonstrates a lipid bilayer that is pinned at the right side of the domain using reflective boundaries.  This particular solution is a zero tention state.  This can be verified by running a simulation using the pure solvent solution (set dens_pure_solvent.dat to be dft_dens.dat) as the starting point and obtaining the identical free energy (omega~-4.6) as output.

Input Files for Test problem:
   - dft_input.dat
   - lin_8_1
   - dft_dens.dat
   - dens_pure_solvent.dat

Key Output Parameters (first solution) :
   - niter=1
   - ads[0]=2.85332
   - ads[1]=0.356665 
   - ads[2]=12.0333
   - omega=-4.60126
