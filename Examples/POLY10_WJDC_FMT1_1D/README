 \brief WTC functionals: 5-mer at a hard wall.

Functionals: WJDC, FMT1

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This is a simple initial test problem for the Jain-Dominik-Chapman functionals 
for bonded systems based on Wertheim's theory of associating fluids.  This case is similar to the POLY6_WTC_FMT1_1D 
test case that was set up for WTC functionals.
The adsorptions of all segments should be and in fact are identical for correct stoichiometry.

Input Files for Test problem:
   - dft_input.dat
   - dft_surfaces.dat
   - lin_5mer

Key Output Parameters:
   - niter=11
   - adsorption[0,1,2,3,4]=0.579151
   - energy=0.540969
