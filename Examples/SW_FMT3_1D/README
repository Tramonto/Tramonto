 \brief Square-well fluid near a hard wall.

Functionals: FMT_3, PAIR_SW

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: Single component square-well fluid near a hard wall.  The calculation of the force has not been
implemented, due to the discontinuity in the potential.  Also note that this potential should only be used
for fluid-fluid interactions, not fluid-wall interactions.
