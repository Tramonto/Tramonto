 \brief Lennard-Jones electrolyte (3 components).

Functionals: FMT1,WCA,ELEC

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: 1-1 electrolyte composed of two charged components (ions) and finite sized neutral solvent. Lennard-Jones
attractions are also included via the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson approximation. Note that the two surfaces 
each carry a charge per unit area of 0.3, and the difference in adsorption between species 1 and 0 (the ions) is
0.6 indicating a charge neutral system.  This solution may be compared to MIX6_FMT1_ELEC_1D to see the effect
of adding the Lennard-Jones (dispersion) effects in the functionals.
