 \brief Primitive model electrolyte (2 components).

Functionals: FMT1,ELEC

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: 1-1 electrolyte composed of two charged components (ions) and a dielectric continuum solvent. In this case the ions
are of finite and equal sizes. The DFT includes both hard sphere and electrostatic contributions to the functional. There
are two surfaces in the problem, each with a charge per unit area of 0.3.  Note that the difference in the adsorption of the
two ionic species is 0.6 indicating a charge neutral system overall.  Compare with MIX4_FMT1_ELEC_1D to see the effect
of the hard sphere funtional on the density profiles.Update on 2/3/11: Reiner-Radke approximation to the free energy has been turned off.  Prior to this date, the energy reported in this file was surf_ex_energy=2.432460.
