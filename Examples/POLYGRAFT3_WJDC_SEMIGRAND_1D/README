 \brief grafted 10-mer polymer: end graft to a noninteracting wall. This case includes a free solvent.

Functionals: WJDC, FMT1

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This example is for a grafted polymer immersed in a solvent.   Note that the adsorption of the free chains of the grafted polymer should be 1.8.  The computed
result has an error of 1.2% for a mesh spacing of 0.1sigma.
