 \brief Lennard-Jones electrolyte (3 components) coarse mesh,small domain.

Functionals: FMT1,WCA,ELEC

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: 1-1 electrolyte composed of two charged components (ions) and finite sized neutral solvent. Lennard-Jones
attractions are also included via the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson approximation.  This is identical to case
MIX7_FMT__WCA_ELEC_1D except with a coarsened mesh and a smaller domain.

Input Files for Test problem:
   - dft_input.dat

Key Output Parameters:
   - niter=6
   - adsorption[0]= 0.089822  
   - adsorption[1]= 0.689822  
   - adsorption[2]= 2.583747
