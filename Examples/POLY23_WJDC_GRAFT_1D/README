 \brief grafted, length 49 hard polymer grafted to a hard wall.

Functionals: WJDC, FMT1

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This example is for a grafted polymer.  Note that it uses the Picard solver, which usually works much better for grafted polymers than the Newton solver (a really good initial guess is required for convergence using the Newton solver).  This example reproduces Fig. 2 in: Jain et al, "Modified interfacial statistical associating fluid theory: Application to tethered polymer chains," J Chem Phys 128, 154910 (2008).
