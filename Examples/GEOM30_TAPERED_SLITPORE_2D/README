 \brief 2D tapered slit pore of finite length. Ncomp=2; Vext(integrated)

Functionals: FMT3

Dimensions: 2

Diffusion: No

Notes: surface geometry test - a tapered 2D slit pore of finite length.  This case demonstrates application of a 
linear offset to a planar surface. The surface-fluid interactions are heterogeneous for the two components.
