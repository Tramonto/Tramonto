 \brief WJDC functionals: 5-mer at a hard wall.

Functionals: WJDC, FMT1

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This is indentical to POLY10 except that the polymer architechture is entered in block format rather
than treating every segment as a different component.
This case is similar to the POLY7_WTC_FMT1_1D test case that was set up for WTC functionals.
The ratio of adsorption[1]/adsorption[0]=3/2 is correct.

Input Files for Test problem:
   - dft_input.dat
   - dft_surfaces.dat
   - lin_5mer

Key Output Parameters:
   - niter=11
   - adsorption[0]=1.15830
   - adsorption[1]=1.73745
   - energy=0.540969
