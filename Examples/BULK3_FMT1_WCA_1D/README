 \brief 1D case - compute structure of liquid-vapor interface.

Functionals: FMT1,WCA

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This case tests is the third of a series involving BULK liquid-vapor equilibrium for a single component fluid.  In this problem, the exact binodal found from the BULK2 calculation is used as boundary conditions for a calculation of a bulk two phase (liquid-vapor) interface.  This type of data is useful in wetting calculations.  Note that a step function initial guess profile is used here.
