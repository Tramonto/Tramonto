 \brief 8-2-8 hard polymer at a hard wall.

Functionals: WJDC, FMT3, WCA

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This case is based on the POLY1_CMS_1D 
test problem with stronger attractive interactions implemented.  The direct correlation function included in this
test problem is _NOT_ needed for the WJDC functional, but is handy for running the problem using the CMS functional.  Note that a near identical case is found in POLY13_WJDC_FMT1_1D with the following 
changes: the FMT3 functional is used here, the component version of the WJDC functional (Type_poly=5) is used here, the Schur solvers are turned on, and physics scaling is turned on in this case.
The total polymer density in the bulk for this problem is 0.711.   The 
ratio of ads[0]/ads[1] is 8.42.
