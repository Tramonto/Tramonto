 \brief 3D case - testing continuation boundaries in y and z coupled with a reflective boundary in the RHS of x

Functionals: FMT_1,WCA,ELEC

Dimensions: 3

Diffusion: No

Notes: Testing electrostatics hard sphere functionals and attractions simultaneously.  The resolution is rather low in order to facilitate a reasonably fast test even on a relatively slow platform.  The problem has one explicit charged surfaces with a surface charge density of qe/A=0.3, and one implicit reflected charged surface across a reflective boundary.  This test is part of a series designed to test various boundary conditions.
