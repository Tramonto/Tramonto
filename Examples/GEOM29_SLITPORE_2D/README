 \brief 2D slit pore of finite length. One wall is smooth, the other is rough. Ncomp=2; Vext(integrated)

Functionals: FMT3

Dimensions: 2

Diffusion: No

Notes: surface geometry test - 2D slit pore of finite length.  The system is heterogeneous with one smooth
and one rough wall.  One species is more attracted to teh smooth wall, the other is attracted to the rough wall.
