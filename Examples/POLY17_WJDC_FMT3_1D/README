 \brief WJDC functionals: blocked polymer blend.

Functionals: WJDC,FMT3

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: This case is a polymer blend with two polymer components.  Like the POLY9 test case, it is based on 
parameters used to generate  figure 7 of Tripathi and Chapman, J Chem. Phys. 2005.  The
first component is an 8-mer, the second component is a 4-mer.  
The two species are homopolymers and the adsorption reported is a sum over the segment
adsorptions for the segments on the 8-mer (adsorption[0]) and the 4-mer (adsorption[1]).
This case is identical to POLY12 with the following changes:  The FMT3 functional is used
for hard sphere terms, the component version of WJDC (Type_poly=5) is solved, the Schur solvers
are turned on, and physics scaling is turned on.
