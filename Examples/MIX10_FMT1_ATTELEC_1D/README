 \brief Primitive model electrolyte (2 components).

Functionals: FMT1,SMF

Dimensions: 1

Diffusion: No

Notes: 1-1 electrolyte composed of two charged components (ions) dielectric continuum solvent. In this case the ions
are of finite and equal sizes. The DFT includes both hard sphere and strict mean field contributions to the functional
where a Coulomb potential with a long cutoff (no shift) is used as the interaction potential. There
are two surfaces in the problem, each with a charge per unit area of 0.3.  Note that the difference in the adsorption of the
two ionic species is 0.49 indicating that charge neutrality is not perfect for this system.  This demonstrates why 
charged systems should be treated with a coupled Poisson solve. 
Compare with MIX4_FMT1_ELEC_1D where a Poisson solve is performed.
