 \brief 3D rough compound cylindrical finite-length pore with two types of surface-fluid chemistry. Vext(integrated)

Functionals: FMT3

Dimensions: 3

Diffusion: No

Notes: surface geometry test - rough compound cylindrical pore of finite length in 3D. Two cylindrical pore wedges combine
to form one heterogeneous cylindrical pore. Vext(integrated).
