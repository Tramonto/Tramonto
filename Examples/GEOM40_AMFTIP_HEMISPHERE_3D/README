 \brief 3D model of a small AFM tip with a hemispherical tip structure. 

Functionals: FMT3

Dimensions: 3

Diffusion: No

Notes: surface geometry test - a 3D hemisphere interacting with a solvated surface.  This could be one model for an AFM tip, but note the base dimension of the pyramid is smaller than a typical AFM tip by a factor of 2-5.

Input Files for Test problem:
   - dft_input.dat

Key Output Parameters:
   - niter=10
   - adsorption[0]=1168.38
   - surf_ex_energy=77.8387
